# myQuickBooksAPI
My quick QuickBooks api tool

For easy setup and utilization of the Intuit QB API.


## TODO
- [ ] Evaluate node-quickbooks: currently not in use, thought syntax and structure probably more express friendly. Currrent enpoints pulled from postman example and posts and get all's are funky.
  > - [ ] fix funky get all's and string formats or use node-quickbooks and incorporate missing endpoints and authentication tools.
- [ ] Build basic encryption tools.
- [ ] Build basic db models needed for connections.
